Conclusions:- 

1.It is identified that on Wednesdays and late evening, most of the users suffer from 'No Cabs Available'. 
Business should try to increase supply of rides during this time. As we show there is a peak of 'Cabs not available' on late evening 

2. It is evident that most of the rides get cancelled early morning by drivers from city to airport,              
 which could be due to several reasons i.e drivers are not willing to take rides 
 may be they are not able to find ride back to city easily in the morning.
